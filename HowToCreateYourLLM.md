# How To Create Your LLM

## Introduction

DrunkenBot LLM-IDE is a desktop workflow for building a small local language
model from your own text, PDFs, and source-code files. The app guides you
through four main stages:

1. Prepare a clean dataset.
2. Choose tokenizer, model, and training settings.
3. Train, resume, or fine-tune the model.
4. Benchmark, export, and test the model in chat.

The most important rule is consistency: once you train a model family, keep the
same tokenizer and compatible architecture when you continue training or
fine-tune from an existing checkpoint.

## Workflow Overview

Use staged training:

1. **Base pretraining**: train from scratch on local text/code/PDF material and
   optional base corpora. This teaches grammar, language patterns, code syntax,
   and next-token prediction.
2. **Instruction fine-tuning**: load the base checkpoint and train on
   instruction data such as Alpaca, Dolly, or SlimOrca. This teaches
   request-following.
3. **Conversation fine-tuning**: load the base or instruction checkpoint and
   train on chat data such as UltraChat, DailyDialog, or OpenAssistant. This
   teaches assistant-style conversation.
4. **Export and test**: export/convert the model, then test it in Chat.

TinyStories is optional base-pretraining data only. It is not selected by
default and is not used for instruction or conversation fine-tuning.

## Step 1: Create Or Open A Project

1. Type a project name in the top bar.
2. Click `New Project` if you want a clean project workspace.
3. Click `Save Project` to create project folders.
4. Use `Open Project` later to restore the saved paths and settings.

The app creates a standard workspace:

```text
project/
  project.json
  training_data/
  datasets/
  models/
  exports/
  cache/
  temp/
```

When the project is created, the bundled default corpus is copied into
`training_data/`. The Dataset Blueprint reads from that project-local copy.
You can add folders, remove files, or turn categories off without modifying the
app's original bundled data.

The Blueprint tree groups files by inferred category and shows estimated tokens
and vocabulary for each file.

### Project Parameters

`Project name`

- Human-readable project name.
- Used when creating the project folder.

`New Project`

- Clears current settings and starts a new project configuration.

`Save Project`

- Saves paths, dataset settings, training settings, export settings, chat
  settings, and artifact summaries to `project.json`.
- If the project was already saved, it saves over the existing project file.

`Open Project`

- Loads an existing `project.json`.
- Restores paths and UI choices.

## Step 2: Prepare Your Dataset

Open the `IN` tab.

After preparation, check three signals:

`Documents`

- Number of source items.
- This can be small if each source file is large.

`Windows`

- Number of train/validation context slices.
- This is what the trainer actually samples.
- More windows usually means less repetition.

`Dataset Statistics`

- `Dataset Composition` shows the data mix as percentages.
- `Token Distribution` shows min, average, median, and max source token length.
- If one file dominates the max value, inspect it for repeated or noisy text.

The dataset stage reads your files, extracts text/code, creates or reuses a
tokenizer, tokenizes the corpus, and writes training/validation token files.

Recommended first run:

1. Choose your source folder.
2. Choose or keep the dataset output folder.
3. Set `Dataset purpose` to `Base pretraining`.
4. Leave `Include online training datasets` off unless you intentionally want
   an online base corpus.
5. Click `Preview Dataset`.
6. Review duplicate and extraction warnings.
7. Enable `Code Training Mode` if your data contains programming content.
8. Keep tokenizer strategy as `Auto` for a new model.
9. Click `Prepare Dataset`.

### Source Array Parameters

`Source vault`

- Folder containing input files.
- Can include PDFs, text files, markdown, JSONL, and source-code files.

Effect:

- More clean data usually improves model behavior.
- Noisy PDFs can teach broken text, bad spacing, or corrupt code.

`Dataset core`

- Stores `corpus.txt`, `tokenizer.json`, `train_tokens.json`,
  `val_tokens.json`, cache files, summaries, and lineage.

`Parallel lanes`

- Number of worker lanes used during dataset preparation.

Effect:

- Higher values can process many files faster.
- Too high can use more memory and disk activity.

Recommendation:

- Use 4 to 8 for normal machines.
- Use more only if you have many CPU cores and enough memory.

`Prepare mode`

- `Incremental update`: reuse cached extraction for unchanged files.
- `Full rebuild`: rebuild the dataset from known source files.
- `Force reprocess`: ignore extraction cache and re-read everything.

Recommendation:

- Use `Incremental update` when adding more files later.
- Use `Force reprocess` after changing extraction/code options.

`Lowercase text`

- Converts text to lowercase before training.

Effect:

- Reduces vocabulary variety.
- Loses case-sensitive information, which is bad for code.

Recommendation:

- Keep off for programming data.

`Code Training Mode`

- Enables code-aware processing.
- Adds code/prose handling and code-specific extraction options.

Recommendation:

- Enable for programming PDFs or source-code folders.

`Include source files`

- Includes actual source-code files such as `.py`, `.js`, `.cpp`, `.java`,
  `.cs`, and others.

Recommendation:

- Enable when training a code-capable model.

`Dataset purpose`

- `Base pretraining`: creates a dataset for training from scratch.
- `Instruction fine-tune`: creates a dataset for request-following adaptation.
- `Conversation fine-tune`: creates a dataset for chat/dialogue adaptation.

Effect:

- Controls which online datasets are visible.
- Helps keep base training separate from later fine-tuning.

Recommendation:

- Use `Base pretraining` for your first model.
- Use `Instruction fine-tune` only after you have a compatible base checkpoint.
- Use `Conversation fine-tune` after the model has learned language basics.

- Maximum rows read from each selected online dataset.
- Use a small number for testing.
- Use larger values only when disk, network, and training time are available.

## Step 3: Configure Tokenizer And Dataset Quality

### Tokenizer Core Parameters

`Auto vocabulary`

- Lets the app choose vocabulary size after reading the dataset.

Effect:

- Small datasets get smaller vocabularies.
- Larger datasets can use larger vocabularies.

Recommendation:

- Keep enabled for most projects.

`Manual vocabulary`

- Vocabulary size used when auto vocabulary is disabled.

Effect:

- Larger vocabulary can preserve more words and code symbols.
- Larger vocabulary increases model output layer size.

Common values:

- `4000`: tiny experiments.
- `8000`: small mixed text/code datasets.
- `16000`: larger datasets.
- `32000`: larger serious datasets.

`Selected vocab`

- Displays the vocabulary size the app selected or calculated.

`Tokenizer policy`

- `Auto`: choose the safest available behavior.
- `Train new tokenizer`: build a new tokenizer from current corpus.
- `Reuse dataset tokenizer`: use existing `tokenizer.json` in the dataset
  folder.
- `Import tokenizer.json`: copy tokenizer from another compatible project.

Recommendation:

- Use `Train new tokenizer` for a brand-new model family.
- Use `Reuse dataset tokenizer` or `Import tokenizer.json` when adding more
  data to an existing model family.

`Import tokenizer`

- Path to tokenizer JSON used by `Import tokenizer.json`.

Effect:

- Keeps token IDs stable across model versions.
- Required for safe continued training across related datasets.

`Min frequency`

- Minimum frequency for a token candidate to enter the tokenizer vocabulary.

Effect:

- Higher values remove rare fragments.
- Lower values keep more rare words/symbols.

Recommendation:

- Use `2` for most datasets.

`Context window`

- Token window used during dataset preparation.

Effect:

- Should match or support your intended training context length.
- Longer context gives the model more surrounding information.

Recommendation:

- Use `256` minimum for code.
- Use `512` or `1024` if memory allows.

`Validation split`

- Fraction of tokens held out for validation.

Effect:

- Validation loss measures generalization.
- Too much validation reduces training data.

Recommendation:

- Use `0.1` for most datasets.
- Use `0.05` for very small datasets.

`Include explanations`

- Keeps prose explanations when code mode is active.

Effect:

- Helps with “explain this code” and assistant-style answers.

`Extract code blocks`

- Attempts to identify code-like blocks inside PDFs/text files.

Effect:

- Better preserves programming examples copied from books.

`Preserve indentation`

- Keeps indentation and line structure.

Recommendation:

- Keep enabled for code training.

`Instruction-style samples`

- Wraps some code/prose examples into task-like samples.

Effect:

- Helps the model learn prompt/answer style behavior.

`Reasoning samples`

- Controls whether examples include reasoning scaffolds.

Options:

- `Reasoning scaffold`: compact reasoning hints.
- `Detailed code reasoning`: more detailed reasoning examples.
- `No reasoning wrapper`: plain text/code samples.

Recommendation:

- Use `Reasoning scaffold` for a balanced small model.

### Dataset Quality Parameters

`Samples`

- Number of extracted training samples.

`Tokens`

- Number of encoded tokens.

Effect:

- More tokens usually improves training.
- Very small token counts produce smoke-test models, not capable assistants.

`Vocab`

- Final tokenizer vocabulary size.

`Code/prose`

- Balance between code samples and explanatory text.

`Cache`

- Number of files reused from extraction cache.

`Warnings`

- Dataset quality warnings such as low token count, duplicate files, or bad
  PDF extraction.

- `n_head`: 8
- `n_layer`: 8
- `Context length`: 512 or 1024
- `Attention`: Multi-head or Grouped-query
- `Backend`: SDPA / Flash when available

### Model Architecture Parameters

`Dataset`

- Prepared dataset folder.
- Must contain `tokenizer.json`, `train_tokens.json`, and `val_tokens.json`.

- `Llama-like`: RoPE, RMSNorm, SwiGLU.

Recommendation:

- Use `Llama-like` for new serious experiments.
- Use `Classic GPT` only for older compatible checkpoints.

`n_embd`

- Embedding/channel width.

Effect:

- Higher values increase model capacity.
- Higher values use more memory and train slower.

Examples:

- `128`: tiny.
- `256`: small.
- `512`: stronger small model.

`n_head`

- Number of attention heads.

Rule:

- `n_embd` must divide evenly by `n_head`.

Examples:

- `512 / 8`

`Attention`

- `Multi-head`: standard full attention.
- `Grouped-query`: shares key/value heads across groups.
- `Multi-query`: all query heads share one key/value head.

Effect:

- Grouped-query and multi-query can reduce memory and generation cost.
- They change checkpoint shape, so they are not interchangeable with normal
  multi-head checkpoints.

`KV heads`

- Key/value head count for grouped-query attention.

Rule:

- Must divide `n_head`.

`Backend`

- `SDPA / Flash when available`: lets PyTorch use optimized attention kernels.
- `Manual`: explicit attention implementation, useful for debugging.

Recommendation:

- Use `SDPA / Flash when available`.

`Window`

- Sliding attention window.

Effect:

- `0` means full context.
- Positive values restrict attention to recent tokens.

`n_layer`

- Number of transformer blocks.

Effect:

- More layers increase depth and capability.
- More layers train slower and use more memory.

`Context length`

- Training sequence length in tokens.

Effect:

- Longer context helps code and long explanations.
- Longer context uses more memory.

Recommendation:

- `512` for useful code experiments.
- `1024+` if GPU memory allows.

`Dropout`

- Regularization probability.

Effect:

- Helps reduce overfitting.

- Too many workers can increase memory use.

`Max grad`

- Gradient clipping norm.

Effect:

- Helps prevent exploding gradients.

`Seed`

- Random seed for repeatability.

## Step 6: Choose Runtime, Resume, And Fine-Tuning Settings

### Runtime Control Parameters

`Device`

- `cuda`: NVIDIA GPU.
- `cpu`: CPU fallback.

`Hardware`

- Shows detected hardware readiness.

`Mode`

- `Pretrain from scratch`: train from random weights on a base dataset.
- `Instruction fine-tune`: load a compatible checkpoint and train on
  instruction data.
- `Conversation fine-tune`: load a compatible checkpoint and train on chat
  data.
- `Fine-tune checkpoint`: generic checkpoint fine-tuning for custom/domain data.

Fine-tuning workflow:

1. Train a base model first with `Pretrain from scratch`.
2. Keep the base model architecture and tokenizer.
3. Prepare a new instruction or conversation dataset.
4. Use `Reuse dataset tokenizer` or `Import tokenizer.json` from the base model
   family.
5. Select `Instruction fine-tune` or `Conversation fine-tune`.
6. Set `Base model` to the compatible checkpoint.
7. Prefer `LoRA adapters` for efficient fine-tuning.
8. Click `Check Fine-tune`.
9. Start training.

`Base model`

- Base checkpoint path for fine-tuning.
- Must match tokenizer vocabulary and model shape.

`PEFT`

- `Full fine-tune`: update all model weights.
- `LoRA adapters`: freeze base model and train small adapters.

Recommendation:

- Use `LoRA adapters` for most fine-tuning.

`LoRA rank`

- Adapter rank.

Effect:

- Higher rank gives more adapter capacity.
- Higher rank creates larger adapter checkpoints.

Recommendation:

- Start with `8`.
- Try `16` for stronger adaptation.

`LoRA alpha`

- Adapter scaling value.

Recommendation:

- Start with `2 * rank`.

`LoRA dropout`

- Dropout inside LoRA adapters.

Recommendation:

- Use `0.05` for code fine-tuning.

`LoRA target`

- `Attention projections`: attach adapters to attention layers.
- `MLP projections`: attach adapters to feed-forward layers.
- `Attention + MLP`: attach adapters to both.

Recommendation:

- Start with `Attention projections`.
- Use `Attention + MLP` if adaptation is too weak.

`Check Fine-tune`

- Checks whether the selected base checkpoint is compatible.

## Fine Tunning Your Model

Fine tuning is the second phase after base pretraining. It does not create a
new model family from scratch. It starts from a compatible checkpoint and adapts
that checkpoint to instruction-following, conversation, code style, or another
domain.

Use fine tuning when:

- You already trained a base model.
- You want the model to answer instructions better.
- You want the model to behave like a chat assistant.
- You want to adapt the model to new domain material without retraining from
  random weights.

### Critical Rule: Use The Same Tokenizer

Always prepare fine-tune data with the tokenizer from the base model.

If the base checkpoint was trained with vocab `16,000`, the fine-tune dataset
must also use vocab `16,000` from the same `tokenizer.json`. A dataset with a
different vocab, such as `10,890`, cannot fine-tune that checkpoint.

Why this matters:

- The checkpoint has learned embeddings for the original token IDs.
- A new tokenizer changes token IDs and vocabulary size.
- The model output layer shape must match the tokenizer vocabulary.

If you see:

```text
Tokenizer vocabulary changed: checkpoint=16000, current=10890.
```

The fix is to rebuild the fine-tune dataset with the base tokenizer.

### Step-By-Step Fine-Tuning

1. Finish or choose a base model checkpoint, usually `final_model.pt`.
2. Confirm the base model folder contains `tokenizer.json`.
3. Open `IN`.
4. Set `Dataset purpose` to `Instruction fine-tune` or `Conversation fine-tune`.
5. Select fine-tune datasets, such as Alpaca, Dolly, SlimOrca, UltraChat,
   DailyDialog, or OpenAssistant.
6. Set `Tokenizer policy` to `Import tokenizer.json`.
7. Browse to the base model folder's `tokenizer.json`.
8. Click `Prepare Dataset`.
9. Open `FT`.
10. Select the matching fine-tune type.
11. Set `Base model` to the base checkpoint.
12. Choose `LoRA adapters` unless you intentionally want full fine-tuning.
13. Click `Apply Recommended LoRA` for safe defaults.
14. Click `Check Fine-tune`.
15. Start fine-tuning only when there are no `[BLOCK]` messages.

### Choosing Fine-Tune Type

`Instruction fine-tune`

- Best for request-following.
- Use Alpaca, Dolly, SlimOrca, and similar instruction datasets.

`Conversation fine-tune`

- Best for chat behavior.
- Use UltraChat, DailyDialog, OpenAssistant, and similar dialogue datasets.

`Fine-tune checkpoint`

- Best for custom/domain adaptation that is not specifically instruction or
  conversation data.

### Recommended LoRA Defaults

Instruction fine-tune:

- LoRA rank: `8`
- LoRA alpha: `16`
- LoRA dropout: `0.05`
- Learning rate: around `0.00005`

Conversation fine-tune:

- LoRA rank: `16`
- LoRA alpha: `32`
- LoRA dropout: `0.05`
- Learning rate: around `0.00003`

General recommendations:

- LoRA target: `Attention projections`
- Schedule: `Cosine decay`
- Gradient clipping: `0.5`
- Keep the same model architecture as the base checkpoint.

### Common Fine-Tune Blocks

`Tokenizer vocabulary changed`

- Cause: fine-tune dataset used a newly trained tokenizer.
- Fix: rebuild the dataset with `Import tokenizer.json` from the base model.

`Context length changed`

- Cause: base checkpoint and current model settings use different context
  lengths.
- Fix: set the current context length to match the base checkpoint.

`n_embd`, `n_head`, or `n_layer` changed`

- Cause: architecture no longer matches checkpoint weights.
- Fix: use the same architecture values as the base checkpoint.

`Effective KV heads changed`

- Cause: attention type or KV heads changed.
- Fix: restore the attention settings used by the base model.

`Mixed precision`

- Enables CUDA AMP.

`Precision`

- `FP16`: fast and memory-efficient on many GPUs.
- `BF16`: more stable on supported GPUs.
- `FP32`: safest but slower and larger.

`Resume latest`

- Continues the newest checkpoint in the model output folder.

Important:

- Resume means continue an interrupted run.
- Fine-tune means start a fresh optimizer run from base weights.

`Safe resume`

- Requires tokenizer, architecture, optimizer, scheduler, and scaler state to
  match for exact continuation.

`Checkpoint`

- Optional exact checkpoint to resume.

`Check Resume`

- Previews whether resume is safe.

`Resume Compatibility`

- Shows `[OK]`, `[WARN]`, and `[BLOCK]` messages for resume/fine-tune checks.

## Step 7: Start Training

1. Click `Refresh Estimate`.
2. Review estimated model size and VRAM.
3. Click `Check Resume` or `Check Fine-tune` if applicable.
4. Click `Start Training`.
5. Watch the `LIVE` tab for loss, throughput, VRAM, RAM, and progress.
6. Use `Stop` if needed. The app saves a resumable checkpoint.

Training outputs:

```text
models/
  final_model.pt
  tokenizer.json
  training_summary.json
  model_lineage.json
  training_history.json
  checkpoints/
```

LoRA outputs also include:

```text
models/
  final_adapter.pt
  checkpoints/checkpoint_<step>.pt
```

Adapter checkpoints are small. `final_model.pt` is merged so benchmark/export
tools can use it like a normal full checkpoint.

## Step 8: Monitor Training Live

Open the `LIVE` tab.

Important metrics:

`Loss`

- Training loss.
- Should generally decrease.

`Validation loss`

- Measures generalization.
- If training loss drops but validation loss rises, the model is overfitting.

`LR`

- Current learning rate from the scheduler.

`Gradient norm`

- Helps detect unstable gradients.

`Weight norm`

- Tracks parameter magnitude.

`Update ratio`

- Indicates how large updates are compared with model weights.

`Tokens/sec`

- Training throughput.

`Samples/sec`

- Batch throughput.

`GPU memory`

- CUDA memory usage.

`System RAM`

- Host memory usage.

`Timeline slider`

- Lets you inspect saved graph values from telemetry history.

## Step 9: Benchmark The Model

Open the `Bench` tab.

1. Keep or edit benchmark prompts.
2. Choose max generated tokens.
3. Choose temperature.
4. Keep `Use KV cache` enabled.
5. Click `Run Benchmark`.

Benchmark output is saved under:

```text
models/benchmarks/
```

Benchmark JSON records:

- prompt
- output
- elapsed time
- generated token count
- token speed
- model lineage

## Step 10: Export The Model

Open the `X` tab.

Common options:

`Create Bundle`

- Copies model, tokenizer, summaries, and metadata into an export folder.

`Quantize Model`

- Creates smaller lower-precision checkpoint artifacts where supported.

`Export HF Package`

- Writes a Hugging Face-style MicroGPT package for portability.

`Convert HF to GGUF`

- Uses llama.cpp converter when configured.

## Step 11: Test In Chat

Open the `Chat` tab.

1. Choose `GGUF / llama.cpp` or `MicroGPT checkpoint`.
2. For GGUF, choose a `.gguf` file.
3. For MicroGPT, choose `final_model.pt` from the model folder.
4. Click `Load Model`.
5. Adjust context, GPU layers, temperature, top-p, max tokens, and thinking
   settings.
6. Send prompts.
7. Use `Unload` when done.

GGUF is best for deployment-style testing. Native MicroGPT checkpoint loading
is useful for testing immediately after training, before GGUF conversion.

## Step 12: Pick The Best Checkpoint

When validation is enabled, the app saves a best-validation checkpoint:

```text
models/
  checkpoints/
    checkpoint_best_val.pt
  final_model.pt
  training_summary.json
```

Use `checkpoint_best_val.pt` when:

- Validation loss improved earlier and then got worse.
- Training loss is very low but validation loss is high.
- You want the checkpoint most likely to generalize.

Use `final_model.pt` when:

- Validation loss kept improving until the end.
- You intentionally trained until the final step.
- You want the exact final training state.

The training log and notifications show the recommended checkpoint.

## Step 13: Read The Architecture Advisor

Before long runs, click `Refresh Estimate` in `AI`.

Check:

- `Params`: where model capacity is being spent.
- `Memory`: rough weights, optimizer, activations, and KV-cache cost.
- `Advisor`: whether the current token budget and model size look balanced.

If the advisor says `data-light`, either add more data or reduce the model.

If it says `memory check`, reduce batch size, context length, embedding size, or
layer count.
